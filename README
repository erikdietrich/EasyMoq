Over the course of time, I've developed a series of utilities that I use in conjunction with Moq.
I use these in a variety of contexts, on a variety of machines, so distributed access to them seemed a lot
more elegant than emailing them to myself or slapping them on my web server.

I'll find it useful here, and if anyone else does too, so much the better.
