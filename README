This started out as a collection of little shortcuts I'd added and tended to use to make it easier
for me to work with Moq, but I'm kind of letting the spirit move me.  What I'm working toward now
is having a full spectrum of test doubles: Dummy, Stub, Fake, Spy, Mock, all of which wrap a Moq<> object
and expose progressively more of its setup functionality as the doubles get smarter.

I'm also planning to add a series of extension methods to Moq (what this project actually started as), and
to provide functionality for uniform representation of non-class types.  The reason for this is that the final
flourish will be to allow automatic class under test constructiont through reflection, eliminating the need
to go back and change tests when xtor signatures change.  The consistent representation of all xtor parameters,
mockable or not, will allow that more easily.
